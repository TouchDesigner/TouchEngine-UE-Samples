## Using a specific build of TouchEngine

By default, the TouchEngine build used by the Unreal Plugin will be from the most recently installed TouchDesigner on the system.

To override and use a specific build, the Unreal Plugin looks for a shortcut named ‚ÄúTouchEngine‚Äù when loading.

If you place any of the following, named "TouchEngine", alongside the .tox you're opening, it will use that build

- a Windows .lnk to a TouchDesigner installation
- a symlink to a TouchDesigner installation
- a full TouchDesigner installation

Lastly, you can also use the env variable `TOUCHENGINE_APP_PATH`.
